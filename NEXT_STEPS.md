## ðŸš€ Recommended Sequential Steps

### âœ… Phase 1: Admin Dashboard - Posts (COMPLETED!)

**Priority: HIGH** - Enable content management without database access

#### 1.1 Posts Management âœ… DONE

- [x] Wire up dashboard posts list to `posts.getAll`
- [x] Add "New Post" button linking to `/dashboard/posts/new`

- `app/dashboard/posts/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit post
- `server/trpc/posts.ts` - Already has CRUD mutations

**Admin auth:**
All admin mutations require header:

```typescript
headers: { 'x-admin-token': 'dev-admin-token' }
```

#### 1.2 Categories Management âœ… DONE

- [x] Wire up dashboard categories to `categories.getAll`
- [x] Add create/edit category pages with forms

- [x] Delete with confirmation dialog
- [x] Toast notifications for all actions
- [x] Test CRUD operations

**Files:**

- `app/dashboard/categories/page.tsx` - List with stats
- `app/dashboard/categories/new/page.tsx` - Create form
- `app/dashboard/categories/[id]/page.tsx` - Edit form
- `server/trpc/categories.ts` - CRUD mutations

#### 1.3 Dashboard Analytics (Next)

- [ ] Display stats from `categories.getStats`
- [ ] Add recent posts list
- [ ] Show draft vs published counts
- [ ] Quick actions (publish draft, edit recent)

---

### Phase 2: Enhanced Editor Experience

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Better content authoring

#### 2.1 Rich Markdown Editor

**Option A: MDX Editor (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install @mdxeditor/editor
```

- WYSIWYG with markdown toolbar
- Image uploads via drag-drop
- Code syntax highlighting
- Table support

**Option B: Tiptap**

```bash
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit @tiptap/extension-markdown
```

- More customizable
- Better for advanced formatting

#### 2.2 Slug Auto-generation

- [ ] Auto-generate slug from title (already have `slugify` util)
- [ ] Check slug uniqueness via `posts.checkSlug`
- [ ] Allow manual override

#### 2.3 Live Preview

- [ ] Split-pane editor with live markdown rendering
- [ ] Preview in light/dark mode
- [ ] Mobile preview toggle

---

### Phase 3: Image Uploads & Media

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Professional content needs images

#### 3.1 Choose Upload Strategy

**Option A: AWS S3 (Currently scaffolded)**
Required env vars in `.env.local`:

```ini
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES=5242880
```

Endpoint: `POST /api/uploads/presign`

- Returns presigned upload URL
- Client uploads directly to S3
- Returns public file URL

**Option B: Uploadthing (Simpler)**

```bash
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

Required env vars:

```ini
UPLOADTHING_URL=https://uploadthing.com/api
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your-secret
```

#### 3.2 Wire Up Uploads

- [ ] Add image picker to post editor
- [ ] Upload cover images via chosen service
- [ ] Store `coverImageUrl` in post
- [ ] Test image display on blog pages

---

### Phase 4: Search & Discovery

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Help readers find content

#### 4.1 Enhanced Search

- [ ] Full-text search already works via `posts.search`
- [ ] Add search results page
- [ ] Highlight search terms in results
- [ ] Add search suggestions/autocomplete

#### 4.2 Related Posts

- [ ] Use existing `posts.getRelated` endpoint
- [ ] Display at bottom of single post pages
- [ ] Algorithm: posts sharing categories

#### 4.3 Category Pages

- [ ] Add `/blog/category/[slug]` route
- [ ] Filter posts by category
- [ ] Show category description

---

### Phase 5: Production Hardening

**Priority: HIGH before deployment**

#### 5.1 Authentication & Security

Current setup uses simple token auth. For production:

**Recommended: NextAuth.js v5**

```bash
npm install next-auth@beta
```

- GitHub/Google OAuth
- Session management
- CSRF protection

Or keep simple auth but:

- [ ] Hash `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (bcrypt)
- [ ] Add rate limiting (upstash/redis)
- [ ] Implement session timeouts

#### 5.2 Error Handling

- [ ] Add global error boundary
- [ ] Implement tRPC error formatter
- [ ] Add Sentry or similar for monitoring
- [ ] Graceful DB connection failures

#### 5.3 Performance

- [ ] Add Redis caching for posts list
- [ ] Implement ISR for static blog pages
- [ ] Optimize images (next/image)
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets

#### 5.4 SEO & Metadata

- [ ] Generate dynamic sitemap (`app/sitemap.ts` exists)
- [ ] Add robots.txt rules (`app/robots.ts` exists)
- [ ] OpenGraph images per post (`app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` exists)
- [ ] Structured data (JSON-LD)

---

### Phase 6: Deployment

**Priority: When ready to go live**

#### 6.1 Choose Platform

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

- Auto-deploy on git push
- Edge functions
- Built-in CDN
- Free hobby tier

**Option B: Railway**

- Postgres included
- Simple pricing
- Good for full-stack apps

**Option C: Self-hosted (VPS)**

- More control
- Requires Docker knowledge
- Use PM2 for process management

#### 6.2 Production Checklist

- [ ] Set all production env vars
- [ ] Use strong `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure CORS if needed
- [ ] Add analytics (Plausible/Umami)

3. Test live site thoroughly (2 hours)
4. Set up backups and monitoring (1 hour)

## ðŸš¦ Current Blockers: NONE

Everything is working and ready to build on. Your next immediate action should be:

**â†’ Open http://localhost:3001/dashboard/posts/new and start wiring the post editor**

The tRPC mutation `posts.create` is ready. You just need to:

1. Build the form UI
2. Add markdown textarea
3. Wire up the mutation with admin token
4. Test creating a post

Would you like me to build the post editor next, or do you want to focus on a different feature?
