  { name: "Red", value: "#EF4444" },
  { name: "Orange", value: "#F97316" },
  { name: "Yellow", value: "#EAB308" },

```

### Stats Fetching

useEffect(() => {
  trpc.categories.getStats
    .query()
    .then(setStats)
    .catch(() => {});
}, []);
```

### Slug Validation (Create)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!slug) {
    setSlugTaken(false);
    setCheckingSlug(false);
    return;
  }
  setCheckingSlug(true);
  const t = setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      const categories = await trpc.categories.getAll.query();
      const exists = categories.some((c: any) => c.slug === slug);
      setSlugTaken(exists);
    } catch {
      setSlugTaken(false);
    } finally {
      setCheckingSlug(false);
    }
  }, 400);
  return () => clearTimeout(t);
}, [slug]);
```

### Slug Validation (Edit - Excludes Current)

```typescript
const exists = categories.some(
  (c: any) => c.slug === slug && c.id !== categoryId
);
```

### Delete with Confirmation

```typescript
const handleDelete = (category: any) => {
  if (
    confirm(
      `Are you sure you want to delete "${category.name}"? This will remove it from all posts.`
    )
  ) {
    const toastId = toast.loading("Deleting category...");
    deleteCat.mutate(category.id, {
      onSuccess: () => {
        toast.success("Category deleted successfully!", { id: toastId });
      },
      onError: (error: any) => {
        toast.error(error?.message || "Failed to delete category", {
          id: toastId,
        });
      },
    });
  }
