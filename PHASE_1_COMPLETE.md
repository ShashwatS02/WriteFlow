## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Form State Management

```typescript
const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
const [slug, setSlug] = useState("");
const [autoSlug, setAutoSlug] = useState(true);
const [excerpt, setExcerpt] = useState("");
const [content, setContent] = useState("");
const [cover, setCover] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [selectedCats, setSelectedCats] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
const [slugTaken, setSlugTaken] = useState(false);
const [checkingSlug, setCheckingSlug] = useState(false);
```

### Slug Auto-Generation

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoSlug && title) {
    setSlug(slugify(title));
  }
}, [title, autoSlug]);
```

### Slug Validation with Debouncing

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!slug) {
    setSlugTaken(false);
    setCheckingSlug(false);
    return;
  }
  setCheckingSlug(true);
  const t = setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      const res = await trpc.posts.checkSlug.query({ slug, excludeId });
      setSlugTaken(res.exists);
    } catch {
      setSlugTaken(false);
    } finally {
      setCheckingSlug(false);
    }
  }, 400);
  return () => clearTimeout(t);
}, [slug, excludeId]);
```

### Save Handler with Validation

```typescript
const handleSave = async (isPublished: boolean) => {
  if (!title.trim()) {
    toast.error("Title is required");
    return;
  }
  if (!content.trim()) {
    toast.error("Content is required");
    return;
  }
  if (slugTaken) {
    toast.error("Slug already exists. Please choose a different one.");
    return;
  }

  const toastId = toast.loading(
    isPublished ? "Publishing post..." : "Saving draft..."
  );

  create.mutate(
    {
      title: title.trim(),
      slug: slug.trim() || undefined,
      content: content.trim(),
      excerpt: excerpt.trim() || undefined,
      coverImageUrl: cover || undefined,
      categories: selectedCats,
      isPublished,
    },
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        toast.success(
          isPublished
            ? "Post published successfully!"
            : "Draft saved successfully!",
          { id: toastId }
        );
        router.push("/dashboard/posts");
      },
      onError: (error: any) => {
        toast.error(error?.message || "Failed to save post", { id: toastId });
      },
    }
  );
};
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Debounced Validation**: 400ms delay prevents excessive API calls during typing
2. **Optimistic Updates**: React Query handles cache invalidation automatically
3. **Toast Notifications**: Using toast IDs allows updating loading toasts to success/error
4. **Slug Handling**: Auto-generation with manual override provides best UX
5. **Form State**: Separate loading/error states for each async operation improves feedback
6. **Dark Mode**: Consistent `dark:` classes across all elements ensures good contrast

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### TypeScript

- Full type safety with React hooks
- Proper typing for tRPC mutations
- Type-safe route params with Next.js 15

### React Best Practices

- Custom hooks for data fetching (`usePosts`, `useCategories`)
- Controlled components for all form inputs
- useEffect cleanup functions for debouncing
- Conditional rendering with loading states

### Performance

- Debounced slug validation (400ms)
- React Query caching for categories
- Optimistic updates for mutations
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
