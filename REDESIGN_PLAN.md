## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Component Best Practices

1. Always use `cn()` utility for className merging
2. Support dark mode for all components
3. Add proper TypeScript types
4. Include accessible ARIA attributes
5. Add loading states where applicable
6. Implement error boundaries
7. Use Framer Motion for animations

### Animation Guidelines

1. Keep animations under 300ms for interactions
2. Use ease-out for entering elements
3. Use ease-in for exiting elements
4. Stagger children by 50-100ms
5. Always provide reduced-motion alternatives
